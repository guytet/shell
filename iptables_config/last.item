Linkage from install.sh to cent_os.sh is complete, the execution of the whole script for centos
should be tested. 
similar files to cent_os.sh should be written for Debian and Ubuntu, then linked from the final
"while" loop in install.sh.

the centos.sh scrips seems to be working fine on cent os, rules are saved correctly, too.
Now, the execution of that file from install.sh or any of the following files, and the return
to back to those files (if needed), needs to be completed.

Ubuntu VM needs to be installed, just to check if same errors occur as on AWS VM. 
On centos "iptables-services" package needs to be installed, in order to have
full iptables funcionality.
iptables-restore command should be run, then iptables-save > /etc/sysconfig/iptables, in order to make
sure the default settings (which are good, enable ssh inbound, etc), are kept. 

Although it is possible to just work from using the return codes of disable_other_firewall, it is probably 
cleaner to utilize os_finder and possibly along with disable_other_firewall.sh - combine the two into
a path of treating each OS and firewall combo: Disabling, installing/adding/configuring iptables.

the disable_other_firewall script works fine on Ubuntu, disables ufw. There is some output
from insserv which cannot be surpressed, seems like it's going to be inavoidable. 

firewalld is ineed active on a local centos install.

All feasible states of systemctl UFW should be found out. Specifically on Ubuntu system, where
ufw is certainly installed out of the box. 
currently, we have:
if installed and running, retruns 0
if installed but stopped, returns 3
if not present (not installed, nor running), returns 4

So, we need: installed and disabled at boot status.

May 2nd
While the os_finder script can find out correctly Debian, Cent, or Ubuntu, the main goal of finding
the os is to determine if ufw or firewalld must be disabled on boot. 

This may be dirreclty possible by just using systemctl status. The return codes for firewalld or ufw 
are in a file in this directory. 
The return codes seem to hold true across all three distors, so they are portable. 

The AWS version of centos does not have firewalld installed, which is odd, on all other centos seen,
firewalld was the default firewall. An ISO has been downladed, it should be set up as VM and chcked
whether firewalld is installed by default.

It was confirmed that os_finder.sh can identify the correct OS vendor for Centos 7 and Debian 9. 
Need to start up the Ubuntu 16.4 VM on amazon, and check it can retrieve its OS vendor as well.
